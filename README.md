This code defines a function explore that searches through a specified directory and its subdirectories for files with a given file extension. It returns a dictionary that contains each directory's relative path as keys and the count of files with the specified extension in each directory as values. This function is particularly useful for cataloging files with a specific format (e.g., .txt, .jpg) across multiple folders.
