This is a directory explorer function that, given a relative path to a directory and a file extension, returns the count of files with that extension within the directory and its subdirectories as a dictionary.   The output is a dictionary where each key represents the relative path of a directory (relative to the directory where the Python file is located), and each value indicates the count of files with the specified extension directly within that directory. Directories containing no files with the specified extension should not be included in the dictionary.
